# Piano Notes
A visualization of how often individual piano keys are played in well-known classical music pieces.

Final project is on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/139799525/Piano-Notes?).

To create these visualizations, I wrote a Python script that ingests MusicXML files and uses the [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) library to parse them. This script tabulates the number of times a specific piano key occurs for each note in that piece.

I then visualized this data using d3 in this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@alicefeng/piano-notes).

Hello, testing 123.
